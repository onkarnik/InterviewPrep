	SORTING ALGORITHMS
	-------------------

BUBBLE SORT :
	
	- Works like a bubble that compares two ADJECENT numbers and swap them.
	-after first pass--> gretest element will be at the last of the array.
	- linear algo.
	- maintains flag for number of swaps happens..thas why best case ie sorted array as input will have O(n)
	- best case - O(n)
	- avg case - O(n^2)
	- worst case O(n^2)
	
SELECTION SORT :
	
	- Selects the SMALLEST element in array and swaps it at front.
	- max swaps can be performed = (n-1)
	- no of swap operations are minimum of all.
	- best case - O(n^2)
	- avg case -  O(n^2)
	- worst case- O(n^2)	

Insertion SORT : 
	
	- Compare a[1] element to its predeccessor and swaps them.
	- works best for small sized arrays and element if it is already sorted or some elements are misplaced.
	- python used tim sort (merge sort + insertion sort)
	- if array is sorted..we never go in innerloop hence best case - O(n)
	- best case -O(n)
	- Avg case - O(n^2)
	- Worst case O(n^2) 
	
	
MERGE Sort : 

	- Divide and conqure algo
	- Divide array into two parts. keeps divin
