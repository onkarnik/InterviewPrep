	ArrayList	
	---------
	java.util.ArrayList
	1. Dynamic size
	- dont have to assign space in advance (eg. can add size dynamically as needed)
	2. Rich library functions
	- contains = search for element
	- add at index.
	- remove item
	- find 1st occurance of item
	3. ways of creating arrylist
	 3.1 default(without capacity)
	 3.2 specify capacity  
	 3.3 from other colletion eg. HashSet
	 
	4. arrylist.size() = big O(1)
	 - updates each time item is added 
----------------	 
	 Arrays (Operations)
	 --------
	 1 Insert = big O(n)
	 2 Search 
	   a. sorted = big O(log n)
	   b. Un-sorted = big O(n)
	 3 Delete = big O(n)
	 -------
	 
	 array.length = is a final variable
